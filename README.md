# Reinforcement learning in portfolio management

## Introduction
====
Motivated by "A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for the Financial Portfolio Management Problem" by [Jiang et. al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10059) [1]. In this project:
+ Implement two state-of-art continous deep reinforcement learning algorithms, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO) in portfolio management. 
+ Experiments on different settings, such as changing learning rates, optimizers, neutral network structures, China/America Stock data, initializers, noise, features to figure out their influence on the RL agents' performance(cumulative return).
